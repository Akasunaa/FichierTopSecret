  speech:
  - Yeah yeah, I surrender, I surrender...
  - It's pointless to fight against someone who is stronger than me...
  - And I also have no powers left....
  - Well, it doesn't matter, you are too late.
  - I used all my powers to create a powerful Reality Bomb, hidden deep in the spaceport.
  - Once it detonates, it will take this city and Triton together in hell !
  - And not only will the debris cascade shatter the rest of the Protectorate's orbital
    fleets and stations, it will also shatter their prestige !
  - And soon, that forsaken power will crumble back into the depths of Neptune...
  - Hahahaha !
  - Of course, I surrender, O bringer of justice...
  - I wouldn't want to miss out that fiery end for anything....
