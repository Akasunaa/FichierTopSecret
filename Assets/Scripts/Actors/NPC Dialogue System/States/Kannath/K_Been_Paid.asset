  - Come on J...
  - Ya can't con a con woman that easily...
  - Aw, come on, we both know I meant an EX-con woman...
  - Hahaha, fair, fair... Well, water under the bridge, I already spent my time on
    lil' Pluto... It's ya credits after all ! Thanks for your patronage !
  - So, I heard from perfectly legimitate and authorized sources that an ex-soldier
    was onboard last week's planet-ferry.
  - And that same perfectly legit source states that the "ex-soldier" managed to
    escape border control over the Demioth Quadrant before rushin' to hide in the
    Aikara's factory...
  - And J, do ya know many who can take out a dozen XV12 droids on their own ?
  - So yeah, I think that might be your guy... I guess you'll find him at the factory
    across the plaza... And J, be careful ya hear ? Ya still owe me a bunch of credits
    !
