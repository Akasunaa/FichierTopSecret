  - Nice one J ! Usually it takes me around two or three cycles before I can wake
    up the bastard...
  - Can't handle his damn poison...
  - Goddamn Aikara suits... A bunch of weirdos I tell ya.... Acting all mighty and
    proud at day, and smashing their livers at night...
  - So, I heard from perfectly legimitate and authorized sources that an ex-soldier
    was onboard last week's planet-ferry.
  - And that same perfectly legit source states that the "ex-soldier" managed to
    escape border control over the Demioth Quadrant before rushin' to hide in the
    Aikara's factory...
  - And J, do ya know many who can take out a dozen XV12 droids on their own ?
  - So yeah, I think that might be your guy... I guess you'll find him at the factory
    across the plaza... And J, be careful ya hear ? Ya still owe me a bunch of credits
    !
