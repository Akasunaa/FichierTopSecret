  speech:
  - Such a fine city, is it not ?
  - No, no, let's not blind ourselves... It's quite the gutter.
  - You're jovian right ? I can tell, I was deployed there during the Ganymede Revolt.
  - Don't know why you would come all the way to the city of the Immortals though
  - Trust me, the sooner you leave, the sooner you'll be happy...
  - Take the factory ! That decrepit monument of the ages has been shutdown for several
    cycles now... What a shame...
  - Of course I know why. You don't get where I am in life by being blind and deaf
    to the world.
  - Why would I tell you ? Where's my incentive ?
  - How about some... you know...
  - ....cash ? But you didn't hear that from me.
